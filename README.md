In addition to exercise, it promotes healthy eating habits by allowing users to explore nutritional information, track calorie intake, and even scan meals for automatic calorie estimates. Users can also create and follow healthy recipes, making meal preparation part of their wellness journey.

To support hydration and overall well-being, TurpoFit includes daily water intake tracking and progress monitoring tools.
