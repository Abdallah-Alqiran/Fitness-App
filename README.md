## **Project Description**

We are currently working on this app as our final project for the Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI), a program in Egypt focused on developing highly skilled professionals to contribute to the country's digital transformation.

Our fitness app is still in development. We are working on creating a platform that will offer personalized workout routines, tracking, and progress monitoring. Our goal is to break down the development into smaller parts, gradually designing and refining features to help users on their fitness journeys. This app aims to encourage a healthier lifestyle, with tools that motivate and guide users every step of the way.

Our goal is to create an app that empowers users to take control of their fitness journeys by providing personalized workout plans, tracking tools, and the ability to set and achieve their fitness goals.
